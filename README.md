# moredatatools

A collection of statistics tools designed to extend those in the *datatool* package.

Useful and general tools here will be moved to the datatools package (should they
be accepted). Collections of specific tools might be moved out into their own libraries.
If this is done I will try to maintain links from this library to other tools.
